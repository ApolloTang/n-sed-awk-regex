:: Alternation and character class, thier different and similarity

    Consider the following:

        The class [abc]
        and the alternation (a|b|c)

    effectively mean the same thing, but the similarity in this example
    does not extend to the general case.

    A character class match exactly one character, no matter how
    long or short the specified list of characters might be.

    Alternation on the other hand, can have arbitrarily long alternatives
    like:

        \<(1,000,000|million|thousand thou)\>

    Alternation, however, can't be negated like a character class.

    ----

    Consider the following:

        /^From|Subject|Date: hello/
        /^(From|Subject|Date): hello /

    Both appear to matches lines beginning with

        "From: hello", "Subject hello", or "Date: hello".

    But the first one won't work -- the regEx is composed
    of three alternatives that match:

        "^From" or "Subject" or "Date: hello"

    which is not particularly useful.

    If you want the leading caret and trailing 'hello' apply
    to each alternative, use parentheses to "constrain" the alternation.
