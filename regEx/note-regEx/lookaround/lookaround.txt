Lookaround
==========

Lookaround uses its subexpression to check the text, but only
to find a location in the text at which it can be matched, not
the actual text it matches.

Lookaround constructs are similar to word-boundary metacharacters
like \b or the anchors ^ and $ in that they don't match text, But
lookaround is a much more general construct than the special
case word boundary and anchors.



         Name	              What it Does
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
(?=foo)	 Lookahead	          Asserts that what immediately follows the
                              current position in the string is foo

(?<=foo) Lookbehind	          Asserts that what immediately precedes
                              the current position in the string is foo

(?!foo)	 Negative Lookahead	  Asserts that what immediately follows the
                              current position in the string is not foo

(?<!foo) Negative Lookbehind  Asserts that what immediately precedes
                              the current position in the string is not foo

lookahead
---------
lookahead peeks forward in the text (toward the right) to see
if its subexpression can match, and is successful as a regex
component if it can.

Positive lookahead is specified with the special sequence (?=⋯),
such as with (?=\d), which is successful at positions where a digit
comes next.

lookbehind
----------
lookbehind looks back (toward the left). It's given with the
special sequence (?<=⋯), such as (?<=\d), which is successful
at positions with a digit to the left (i.e., at positions after
a digit).

For example, given a string "abcdefghijk", lookahead:

    (?=efg)

will match the position between "d" and "e" in string such that
/.(?=efg)/ will match "d" because "d" is located before
the match position.

On the other hand /(?=efg)./ will match "e" because "e" is located
after the match position.

As for lookbehind:

    (?<=efg)

will match the position between "g" and "h" that /.(?<=efg)/
will match "g" because "g" is located before the match position.
And /(?<=efg)./ will match "h" because "h" is located after
the match positon.

Positive Lookahead
------------------

    q[^u]

Does not match "iraq", but positive the look ahead

    q(?!u)

will match "iraq".
