Parentheses are use to:

 1. limit the scope of alternation:

     (4th|forth)

 2. group items into units to which you an apply quantifiers:

     (4th|4) can be exressed as (4(th)?)
     <HR(\s+SIZE\s*=\s*[0-9]+)?\s*>

 3. Back referencing

    Match new string that is the same as some string matched earlier
    in the expression.

       ([a-z]+)\s+\1\b

    The above matches two identical lower case word separated by one
    or more space. the "\b" in the end makes sure that we are matching a
    word boundary (not something like 'the theft')

    multiple back referencing
    -------------------------
        you can have more than one set of parentheses in a regular expression
        Use \1, \2, \3, etc., to refer to the first, second, third, etc
        sets.

        Pairs of parentheses are numbered by counting opening
        parentheses from the left, so with ([a-z])([0-9])\1\2, the \1 refers
        to the text matched by [a-z], and \2 refers to the text matched
        by [0-9].
