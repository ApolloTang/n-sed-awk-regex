Parentheses are use to:

  1. limit the scope of alternation:

      (4th|forth)

  2. group items into units to which you an apply quantifiers:

      (4th|4) can be exressed as (4(th)?)
      <HR(\s+SIZE\s*=\s*[0-9]+)?\s*>

  3. Back referencing

     Match new string that is the same as some string matched earlier
     in the expression.

        ([a-z]+)\s+\1\b

     the above matches two identical lower case word separated by one
     or more space. the /\b/ in the makes sure that we are now at an
     word boundary (not some thing like 'the theft')
