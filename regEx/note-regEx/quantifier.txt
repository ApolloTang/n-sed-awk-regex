::: Some consideration on optional match

    Considering matching "color" or "colour" with

        /colou?r/

    The "u?" in the regEx always result in succesful match.
    The whole points of "optional match" is that it's successful
    either way.

::: Use quantifer to simplify alternation:

    (July|Jul) can be expressed as (July?)

::  Quantifier can attach after a parenthesized expression. Inside
    the parentheses can be as complex a subexpression as you
    like, but "from the outside" it is considered a single unit:

        (4th|4) can be exressed as (4(th)?)
        <HR(\s+SIZE\s*=\s*[0-9]+)?\s*>
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::: Quantifier also see preceeding character class as single unit:

        [A-Z]?[0-9]?
