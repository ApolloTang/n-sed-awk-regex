Consider the following:

    /^From|Subject|Date: ./
    /^(From|Subject|Date): ./

Both appear to matches lines beginning with "From: .", "Subject .",
or "Date: .".  But the first one won't work -- the regEx is composed
of three alternatives that match: "^From" or "Subject" or "Date: ."
which is not particularly useful.  If you want the leading caret
and trailing dot apply to each alternative, use parentheses to
"constrain" the alternation.
