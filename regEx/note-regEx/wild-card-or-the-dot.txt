dot ( Wild card )
-----------------

    Match any character except the new line.

    Note about matching new line character:

        Consider the following 3 lines of text:

            This is the first line MATCH MATCH
            This is the second line MATCH MATCH
            This is the final line MATCH MATCH

        Despite that there are end of line charectors at the end
        of every line, /MATCH./ will not match the second "MATCH" in
        the line.

        There is and option in some flavour of regEx called "Single-line"
        mode. When this mode is on, all end of line chracters is ignored
        until the final end of line character. Thus in the above example,
        the second "MATCH" in first line and second line will
        be matched.

        ( in awk, /./ does match new line character)


    The syntax between Unix shell's glob and regEx wild card:

        The shell's wild card "*" match any number of
        charactors.

        regEx wild card "." match only charactor.
        The equivalent of shell's "*" in regEx is ".*"

        In regEx, "*" is an quantifier, thus by itself is meaning
        less. Quantifier require to act on an object to have
        meaning.
