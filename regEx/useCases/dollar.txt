dollar amount (with optional cents)

    \$[0-9]+(\.[0-9][0-9])?

"a literal dollar sign, a bunch of one thing (one or more digit),
and finally perhaps another thing (2 digits)."


This example is a bit na√Øve for several reasons. It
considers dollar amounts like $1000, but not $1,000. However, it
does allow for optional cents, but frankly, that's not really
very useful when applied with egrep. egrep never cares exactly
how much is matched, but merely whether there is a match. Allowing
something optional at the end never changes whether there's an
overall match to begin with.
